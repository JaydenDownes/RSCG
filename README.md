# Reddit Short-Form Content Generator (RSCG)

RSCG is a Python-based project for automated short-form video content creation using Reddit data. It leverages web scraping, AI text-to-speech (TTS), and code-based video editing to transform engaging Reddit threads into shareable videos.

- Overlays audio on randomly cut background video.
- Basic editing capabilities (text overlays).

## Output:

- Generates short-form videos (e.g., TikTok, YouTube Shorts format) ready for sharing.

## Technical Details:

- Programming Language: Python
- Dependencies:
  - Web scraping library
